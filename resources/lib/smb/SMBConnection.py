        Create a new SMBConnection instance.

        *username* and *password* are the user credentials required to authenticate the underlying SMB connection with the remote server.
        File operations can only be proceeded after the connection has been authenticated successfully.

        Note that you need to call *connect* method to actually establish the SMB connection to the remote server and perform authentication.

        :param string my_name: The local NetBIOS machine name that will identify where this connection is originating from.
                               You can freely choose a name as long as it contains a maximum of 15 alphanumeric characters and does not contain spaces and any of ``\/:*?";|+``
        :param string remote_name: The NetBIOS machine name of the remote server.
                                   On windows, you can find out the machine name by right-clicking on the "My Computer" and selecting "Properties".
                                   This parameter must be the same as what has been configured on the remote server, or else the connection will be rejected.

                                    The choice of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 is configured on the remote server, and there is no mechanism to auto-detect which algorithm has been configured.
                                    Hence, we can only "guess" or try both algorithms.
                                    On Sambda, Windows Vista and Windows 7, NTLMv2 is enabled by default. On Windows XP, we can use NTLMv1 before NTLMv2.
